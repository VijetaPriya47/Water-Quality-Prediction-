# 🌊 Water Quality Analysis 🚰

Ensuring access to **safe drinking water** is vital for health and well-being. It’s a fundamental human right, and maintaining water quality is a major health and development priority across national, regional, and local levels. Investing in clean water supplies and sanitation not only reduces health risks but also results in significant economic benefits by lowering healthcare costs.

### 🔬 Dataset Information:

This project analyzes the potability of water based on **physicochemical tests**, aiming to predict whether water is safe for human consumption. Our dataset includes the following attributes:

**Input Variables:**
1. **pH**: Acidity/Alkalinity of water.
2. **Hardness**: Capacity to precipitate soap (mg/L).
3. **Solids**: Total dissolved solids (ppm).
4. **Chloramines**: Amount of chloramines (ppm).
5. **Sulfate**: Amount of dissolved sulfates (mg/L).
6. **Conductivity**: Electrical conductivity (μS/cm).
7. **Organic Carbon**: Amount of organic carbon (ppm).
8. **Trihalomethanes**: Trihalomethanes concentration (μg/L).
9. **Turbidity**: Water's light-emitting property (NTU).

**Output Variable:**
- **Potability**: Indicates if the water is safe for drinking (1: Potable, 0: Not Potable).

## 🧠 Algorithms

We explore multiple machine learning models to predict water potability:
1. **Logistic Regression**
2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
3. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
4. **Decision Tree**
5. **Random Forest**
6. **XGBoost**

**Best Model Accuracy So Far**: 🚀 **70.00%**

But we’re not stopping there! We’re actively improving this by testing more advanced techniques and fine-tuning parameters.

## 🚀 What’s Next?

We are **building a dynamic website** using **Streamlit** to make this analysis more accessible and user-friendly! The web interface will allow users to input water characteristics and get real-time predictions on potability, along with insightful visualizations of water quality data.

Stay tuned for updates as we make the world of **water safety** more interactive and engaging!
